Well, it was written "don't click here". 

But since I have you here, I have some additional recommendation for you.

If you *don't want* to join an awesome company of geeky people, creating the software used worldwide by law enforcement to enhance, analyze and authenticate images and videos during investigations, *don't send* your CV/resume to us.

If you really *don't want* to follow my advice, check out our [careers page](https://ampedsoftware.com/careers).
